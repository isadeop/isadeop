- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @isadeop, you can also call me Isadora or Isa.

  Right now my repositories are all private, but I'll be posting some of my code soon.
  
  I am a very curious person and I love to learn new things!
  Iâ€™m currently studying JavaScript, focused on backend and will soon begin a bootcamp FullStack Java+Angular.
  If you want to exchange study materials or study together, feel free to contact me!
  
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me you can find me on insta with the same @ or send me an e-mail, as it's listed on my profile.
  Nice to meet you, have a lovely day or night from wherever you are seeing this!
